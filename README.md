## Installation of the App Build Environment

__To develop ctrlX Apps we recommend to use a ctrlX App Build Environment.__ Otherwise a Ubuntu Server or Desktop system is needed.

How to create and start a ctrlX App Build Environment is described in [ctrlX WORKS App Build Environment](https://boschrexroth.github.io/ctrlx-automation-sdk/setup_qemu_ctrlx_works.html)

If your ctrlX App Build Environment is running, you can log in and install the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK - see below.

## Installation of the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK

__These installation steps are required on both an App Build Environment and an Ubuntu Server or Desktop System.__

### Clone and Install the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK

Start a console session, change to your destination directory and enter:

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-automation-sdk/main/scripts/clone-install-sdk.sh && chmod a+x *.sh && ./clone-install-sdk.sh

As a result, your local copy of the github repo is stored within the directory __ctrlx-automation-sdk/__

### Install required Debian packages

Stay in the directory and enter:

	ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts/install-required-packages.sh

### Install snapcraft

Stay in the directory and enter:

	ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts/install-snapcraft.sh

### Install ctrlx-datalayer Debian package

Stay in the directory and enter:

	ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts/install-ctrlx-datalayer.sh ctrlx-automation-sdk/deb

### Building Sample Projects

Now you are able to build the C++ and Python sample projects.

To build sample projects in other programming languages further installation steps are required.

Change to the directory `ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts` and start the according install script.

For go samples:

	install-go.sh

For .NET samples:

	install-dotnet-sdk.sh

For nodejs samples:

	install-nodejs-npm.sh

## Building a snap using Docker

Building a snap using Docker allows you to:

- build on Windows, macOS, or a non-Ubuntu Linux distribution
- cross-compile to arm64 from a different architecture
- avoid needing to install anything snap-related on your machine (depending on your distro, this isn't even possible or is hacky at best)

For simple snaps, this can be done in one command using Canonical's official images. 

You should remove anything related to cross-compilation within your `snapcraft.yaml` as Docker will be handling the emulation by passing the `--platform` flag.

For example, to build a snap on a ctrlX Core X3 on Ubuntu Core 22, `cd` into your project directory containing your `snap/snapcraft.yaml` and run:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm --platform=linux/arm64 -v `pwd`:/project ghcr.io/canonical/snapcraft:8_core22 pack \; -v
```

This will create your `.snap` file within the current directory which you can install using the ctrlX web interface.

In case your snap needs some extra dependencies to build, for example `curl`, you can create a `Dockerfile` such as this based on that image and install what you need:

```docker
FROM ghcr.io/canonical/snapcraft:8_core22
RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl
```

Build the image and give it a name that makes sense to you, such as `my-ctrlx-image`. Make sure to include the correct `--platform` for your target device architecture.

```bash
sudo docker build . -t my-ctrlx-image --platform=linux/arm64
```

Then run the same command using your new image instead

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm --platform=linux/arm64 -v `pwd`:/project my-ctrlx-image pack \; -v
```

There is a working example in [samples-node/datalayer.client.browse](./samples-node/datalayer.client.browse/)
